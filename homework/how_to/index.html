        <h2></h2>
        <h3>Carve a pumpkin</h3>
        <img src="images/lilo.gif" alt="" width="500">
        <p>You can buy pumpkins at the supermarket around Halloween. Cut open the top, remove the seeds and pulp from the insides, and cut out fun shapes or faces onto the sides of the pumpkins. Place a candle on the bottom of the pumpkin and light it to create an eerie, glowing pumpkin.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="step2">
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>Wear a Halloween costume</h3>
        <img src="images/costume.jpeg" alt="" width="500">
        <p>Dress up scary or just like anything you want.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="step3">
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>Go trick or treat</h3>
        <img src="images/treat.gif" alt="" width="500">
        <p> If you have small children, or are still young enough yourself, trick-or-treating can be fun. Go from house to house with a bucket or bag and ask for collect candy from neighbors. This is a fun way to show off costumes and indulge in some Halloween treats.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="step4">
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>Watch scary movies</h3>

          <img src="images/eng.png" alt="" width="500" class="eng">
        <p>If you want, you can have a movie screening at your party. Show your favorite scary movies that are perfect for the season, like The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, and films from the Halloween franchise.
If you're serving alcohol at your party, have a drinking game where guests have to drink for a variety of reasons. For example, "Drink every time someone screams."</p>
      </li>
      <li id="step5">
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>Have a Halloween party</h3>
        <img src="images/party.jpeg" alt=""width="500">
        <p>
Have everyone wear a costume. Part of the fun of Halloween is dressing up. If you're hosting a party, invite all your guests to wear costumes. If you want, you can even have a contest where guests win different categories like "Scariest Costume," "Funniest Costume," and so on.
You can have a specific theme and have guests dress for that theme. For example, try a sci-fi Halloween party or a Dracula-themed party.
